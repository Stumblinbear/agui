## What is Agui Core?

Agui Core holds the core systems for [`agui`](https://crates.io/crates/agui). It provides the foundation for reactive user interfaces to be built from. It does very little by itself, and is intended to be used with [`agui_primitives`](https://crates.io/crates/agui_primitives) and [`agui_widgets`](https://crates.io/crates/agui_widgets) for behavior. Consider using [`agui`](https://crates.io/crates/agui_core) instead of this directly.
